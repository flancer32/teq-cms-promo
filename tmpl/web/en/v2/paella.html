<h1>Paella in Boldyra</h1>
<p>Kolya, Angelina, and I gathered in Boldyra to cook paella. The recipe and ingredients came straight from Spain.</p>
<p>At first the result looked more like porridge, but after adding khmeli-suneli and a pinch of pepper the dish transformed.</p>
<p>The paella turned out tasty, and we were satisfied.</p>
