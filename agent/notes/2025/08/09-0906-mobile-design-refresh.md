# Task: Mobile design refresh

## Summary
- Improved base layout with container wrapper and CTA button.
- Reworked navigation with accessible toggle and mobile-first classes.
- Added design tokens, spacing utilities, and responsive styles in `web/css/style.css`.

## Observations
- CTA text is identical in both locales; consider localization.
- More page-specific section alternation can be added per page content.

## Suggestions
- Introduce tests or lint scripts to automate style checks.
