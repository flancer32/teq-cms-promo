# Task: Add paella page

## Summary
- Created a Russian page describing cooking paella with Kolya and Angelina.
- Added English translation.
- Linked the page in v2 navigation for both locales.

## Observations
- `ctx` directory is ignored; context file for the new page was left untracked.

## Suggestions
- Consider adding the context repository update for this page separately if needed.
