# Task: Navigation fixes + CTA scope

## Summary
- Moved CTA button into contact page templates and removed from global layout.
- Added header wrapper with responsive padding and adjusted mobile navigation to place hamburger on the right.

## Observations
- CTA link still points to the contact page itself; consider linking directly to a preferred channel (e.g., email) if needed.

## Suggestions
- Review mobile header layout after integration to ensure language switcher and toggle spacing meet design expectations.
